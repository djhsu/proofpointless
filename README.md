# proofpointless

Thunderbird add-on to remove Proofpoint-inserted garbage (e.g., "This Message Is From an External Sender") when you reply-to or forward emails.

To use, create a zip file containing `background.js` and `manifest.json`, and then install the add-on from this zip file in Thunderbird (Tools -> Add-ons and Themes -> Gear icon -> Install Add-on From File...).
